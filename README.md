# Atomic Kitten üê±

An opinionated atomic workstation based on the AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10 `bootc` image.

**Intended for personal use and testing only.**

Built using the [AlmaLinux atomic-respin-template](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-respin-template).


## Key changes from the template

- Switched the base image from the original [`atomic-desktop`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-desktop) to the `kitten-10` `bootc` image  
- Carried over most of the configuration from the original [`atomic-desktop`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-desktop) base image  
- Added multimedia codecs from Negativo17  
- Removed rpm Firefox and some default GNOME programs in favor of Flatpaks  
- Added virtualization support, VS Code, and an opinionated selection of tools, utilities, and fonts  
- Added hibernation fixes from [`atomic-workstation`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-workstation)  


## Experimenting

- Backported GNOME 48 from COPR  
- Adding Steam in to the image ‚Äì probably not feasible..
