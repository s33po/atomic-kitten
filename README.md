# ‚öõÔ∏è Atomic Kitten üê±

An opinionated atomic workstation based on the AlmaLinux OS Kitten 10 bootc image.

_Intended for personal use and testing only._ Built using the [AlmaLinux atomic-respin-template](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-respin-template).


## Key changes üèóÔ∏è

- Switched the base image from the original [`atomic-desktop`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-desktop) to the `kitten-10` bootc image  
- Carried over most of the configuration from the original [`atomic-desktop`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-desktop) base image  
- Included multimedia codecs from EPEL (Negativo17 as secondary option)
- Minimal GNOME base (from Bluefin-LTS) instead of the full `@workstation` install  
- Added virtualization support (QEMU/KVM) and VSCodium  
- Added some stuff like hibernation config from [`atomic-workstation`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-workstation)  
- Added an opinionated selection of basic tools, utilities, and some fonts  
- Installs an small opinionated set of system Flatpaks on first boot  

## Planned changes üöß  

- Re-evaluate the use of Bluefin-LTS's "minimal" GNOME base ‚Äî possibly switch back to a full `@workstation` install and just remove unnecessary programs  
- Backport GNOME 48 from COPR  
- Consider including Steam in the image to avoid Flatpak-related Steam issues, but it might not be feasible ü§î

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This WILL break, do not use ‚ö†Ô∏è

Instead, use [`atomic-respin-template`](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/atomic-respin-template) to create your own repo, or use AlmaLinux's official atomic-desktop images, or ready-to-go Fedora alternatives like Universal Blue's images.
